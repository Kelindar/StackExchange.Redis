Misakai.Storage.Redis
=====================

Fork of [StackExchange.Redis](https://github.com/StackExchange/StackExchange.Redis).

StackExchange.Redis is a high performance general purpose redis client for .NET languages (C# etc). It is the logical successor to [BookSleeve](https://code.google.com/p/booksleeve/),
and is the client developed-by (and used-by) [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) for busy sites like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). For the full reasons
why this library was created (i.e. "What about BookSleeve?") [please see here](http://marcgravell.blogspot.com/2014/03/so-i-went-and-wrote-another-redis-client.html).
